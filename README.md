# SpeedifySharpCLI
An open source C# wrapper package for Speedify CLI

This project is still unstable because 
- json from the CLI isnt well documented
- the cli just spits out json in random order, eg stats.
- It is a bit difficult to split the CLI output if multiple json results are being dumped (any ideas how to simplfy this would be nice)
